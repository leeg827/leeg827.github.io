    <div> I sat up on the bed, in senseless and perfect silence, as if Madden was already peering at me. Something - perhaps merely a desire to prove my total penury to myself - made me empty out my pockets. I found just what I knew I was going to find.</div>
    <div class="pocketcontainer">
        <div class="pocket">
            <div class="pocketitem">
                a letter which I decided to destroy at once (and which I did not destroy), 
                </div>
                <div class="pocketitem">a five shilling piece,</div> 
        </div>
        <div class="pocket">
            <div class="pocketitem"> a red and blue pencil,</div> 
            <div class="pocketitem">a handkerchief</div>
            <div class="pocketitem">- and a revolver with a single bullet. Absurdly I held it and weighed it in my hand, <a href="trainstation.html">to give myself courage. Vaguely I thought that a pistol shot can be heard for a great distance</a></div>
