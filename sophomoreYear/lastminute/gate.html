        <div>Meditating thus I arrived at a high, rusty iron gate. Through the railings I could see an avenue bordered with poplar trees and also a kind of summer house or pavilion. Two things dawned on me at once, the first trivial and the second almost incredible: the music came from the pavilion and that music was Chinese. That was why I had accepted it fully, without paying it any attention. I do not remember whether there was a bell, a push-button, or whether I attracted attention by clapping my hands. The stuttering sparks of the music kept on. 
            
        But from the end of the avenue, from the main house, a lantern approached; a lantern which alternately, from moment to moment, was crisscrossed or put out by the trunks of the trees; a paper lantern shaped like a drum and colored like the moon. A tall man carried it. I could not see his face for the light blinded me. </div>
            
        <div>He opened the gate and spoke slowly in my language. 
            
            "I see that the worthy Hsi P'eng has troubled himself to see to relieving my solitude. No doubt you want to see the garden?" 
                
            Recognizing the name of one of our consuls, I replied, somewhat taken aback. 
                
            "The garden?" 
                
            "The garden of forking paths." 
                
            Something stirred in my memory and I said, with incomprehensible assurance: 
                
            "The garden of my ancestor, Ts'ui Pen." 
                
            "Your ancestor? Your illustrious ancestor? <a href="garden.html">Come in."</a></div>
