It seemed to me that the dew-damp garden surrounding the house was infinitely saturated with invisible people. All were Albert and myself, secretive, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I lifted my eyes and the short nightmare disappeared. In the black and yellow garden there was only a single man, but this man was as strong as a statue and this man was walking up the path and he was Captain Richard Madden.</div>
                <div class="mcdeath">"The future exists now," I replied. "But I am your friend. Can I take another look at the letter?"</div>
                <div class="mcdeath">I had the revolver ready, but before I could fire, I hear a loud bang. It was Madden, he had shot me. The shot was fatal, and everything eventually faded to black.</div>
