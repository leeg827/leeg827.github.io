                <p class="car"> Silently, I dressed, took leave of myself in the mirror, went down the stairs, sneaked a look at the quiet street, and went out. The station was not far from my house, but I thought it more prudent to take a cab.</p>
                <p class="station">I recall that I told the driver to stop short of the main entrance. I got out with a painful and deliberate slowness.

                    <div class="traintalk">I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages.</div>
                    <div class="traintalk">I remember some farmers, a woman dressed in mourning, a youth deep in Tacitus' Annals and a wounded, happy soldier.</div>
                    <div class="traintalk">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</div>
                    <div class="traintalk">Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</div>
                    <div class="traintalk">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform.</div>

                    <div class="sidewalkoff">At last the train pulled out. A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden.</div>
                    <div class="sidewalkoff"><a href="children.html">"Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.</a></div>
