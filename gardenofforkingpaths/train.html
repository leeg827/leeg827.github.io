                <div class="traintalk">I was going to the village of Ashgrove, but took a ticket for a station further on. The train would leave in a few minutes, at eight-fifty. I hurried, for the next would not go until half past nine. There was almost no one on the platform. I walked through the carriages.</div>
                <div class="traintalk">From utter terror I passed into a state of almost abject happiness. I argued, with no less sophism, that my timorous happiness was proof that I was man enough to bring this adventure to a successful conclusion. From my weakness I drew strength that never left me.</div>
                <div class="traintalk">Thus I proceeded, while with the eyes of a man already dead, I contemplated the fluctuations of the day which would probably be my last, and watched the diffuse coming of night.</div>
                <div class="traintalk">The train crept along gently, amid ash trees. It slowed down and stopped, almost in the middle of a field. No one called the name of a station. "Ashgrove?" I asked some children on the platform.</div>

                <div class="sidewalkoff">A man I recognized ran furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform. It was Captain Richard Madden.</div>
                <div class="sidewalkoff">"Ashgrove," they replied. I got out.</div>
